Controls
========

PyXBMCt provides 9 ready-to-use UI controls that are based on the respective :mod:`xbmcgui` controls
with the following differences:

* You donâ€™t need to specify coordinates and size for the controls explicitly.
  The Grid layout manager takes care of control placement.
* All controls that require textures are provided with default textures
  (borrowed from Confluence and Estuary skin resources).
  You can specify your own textures for PyXBMCt controls, but you need to do this through keyword arguments (important!).
* Button caption is center-aligned by default. You can change button caption alignment by providing a necessary alignment
  parameter through a keyword argument (PyXBMCt already includes symbolic constants for control text alignment).
  Since all PyXBMCt Controls are subclassed from ``xbmcgui.Control*`` classes, you can use all parent :mod:`xbmcgui`
  classes' methods to set Control properties.
